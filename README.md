Goals and Procedure
-------------------

The aim of this short project was to get familiar with the DNN possibilities in R, especially while using caret, RSNSS, and h2o. Important emphasis was put on regularization, visualization, and variable importance techniques in order to make the results easily comprehensible. In terms of models, only basic DNN architectures were employed with a varying number and values of hyperparameters in order to find optimal models. 

The main dataset to which most of the code and plots refer displays sensor data of smartphone users in order to predict their behavior. Other plots refer to a movie data set in order to visualize residual predictions.

Plot Overview
-------------

1. Hyperparameter Tuning 
2. GAM-based Hyperparameter Selection
3. Variable Importance Analysis
4. Residual Prediction Analysis (movie dataset)
